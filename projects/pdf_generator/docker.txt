Docker Learning Plan (Beginner to Intermediate)

## 🔰 Week 1: Introduction & Setup
✅ Goals:
- Understand what Docker is and why it’s used.
- Set up Docker on your system.

📚 Topics:
- What is Docker? Containers vs Virtual Machines.
- Docker architecture: Engine, Images, Containers, Registries.
- Install Docker & Docker Desktop (or CLI on Linux).
- Basic Docker commands.

🔧 Practice:
docker --version
docker run hello-world
docker ps
docker images

🎯 Task:
- Run your first container: nginx, alpine, ubuntu.
- Explore DockerHub.

## 🧱 Week 2: Working with Images & Containers
✅ Goals:
- Learn how to use and build your own Docker images.

📚 Topics:
- Dockerfile syntax & best practices.
- Image layers and caching.
- Copying files, setting environment variables, working directory.

🔧 Practice:
- Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js or Python app.
- Build, tag, and run your custom image:
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

🎯 Task:
- Create a basic REST API and dockerize it.
- Push the image to DockerHub.

## ⚙️ Week 3: Volumes, Networking & Compose
✅ Goals:
- Learn how Docker handles storage, networking, and orchestration.

📚 Topics:
- Volumes vs Bind Mounts.
- Container Networking (bridge, host, custom networks).
- Docker Compose for multi-container apps.

🔧 Practice:
- Attach a volume to a container and observe persistence.
- Create a Docker network and connect containers.
- Build a docker-compose.yml for:
  - Node.js + MongoDB
  - Flask + PostgreSQL

docker-compose up

🎯 Task:
- Convert an existing project (e.g., MERN stack or NestJS) to use Docker Compose.

## 🧪 Week 4: Debugging, Optimization & Real-world Scenarios
✅ Goals:
- Debug, optimize, and use Docker in development workflows.

📚 Topics:
- Common issues: port conflicts, logs, container restart policies.
- Multi-stage builds (reduce image size).
- Docker in CI/CD workflows.

🔧 Practice:
- Debug with docker logs, exec, inspect.
- Create a multi-stage Dockerfile.
- Use .dockerignore properly.

🎯 Task:
- Optimize an existing Docker image.
- Set up GitHub Actions to build & push image automatically.

## 🧠 Bonus: Beyond Basics (Optional Week 5)
📚 Topics:
- Docker Swarm basics.
- Intro to Kubernetes (as next step).
- Security best practices (user permissions, scanning images).
- BuildKit for faster builds.
